## Tensor

The tensor is a mathematical function from linear algebra that maps a selection of vectors to a numerical value.
The concept originated in physics Probably the most prominent example that uses the concept of tensors is einstein's general relativity.
and was subsequently used in mathematical subjects like multilinear algebra and differentiable manifolds.

In the field of machine learning, tensors are used as representations for many applications,
such as images or videos. They form the basis for TensorFlowâ€™s machine learning framework, which also takes its name from this.
# different types of tensors
1: scalar

2: vector

3: matrix

4: k-dimensional matrix also called (tensor)
